# Weather Dashboard

This webpage serves the purpose of being able to see the weather outlook for multiple cities. Features include displaying the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index of any searched city, as well as a 5-day forecast that displays temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

The UV Index is color coordinated to show the quality of air. 

Search results are saved and displayed below the search bar and can replicate a past search by clicking on them.
